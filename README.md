# SwiftDictionaries

This project will help you practice the skills and concepts you learned related to strings in Swift. For this project you'll build an app with a text field for the user to enter a word. When they tap the button, the app will look for synonyms for the entered word, and will display them in a text view if any are found.

> A synonym is a word with the same meaning as another word. For example, `difficult` and `hard` are synonyms.
